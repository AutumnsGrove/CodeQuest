üöÄ Post-MVP Phases

After MVP is complete and working, add features incrementally:

- Phase 2 (Week 4-5): Enhanced quests (PR-based, test coverage, chains)
- Phase 3 (Week 6-7): Skills & achievements
- Phase 4 (Week 8-9): Advanced UI (character sheet, inventory, animations)
- Phase 5 (Week 10): Advanced AI (code review, quest generation)
- Phase 6 (Week 11): External integrations (GitHub, WakaTime)
- Phase 7 (Week 12): Polish & documentation

---
üéì Learning Path

This MVP will teach:
- Week 1: Go basics (structs, methods, interfaces, JSON, testing)
- Week 2: Bubble Tea patterns (Model/Update/View, components)
- Week 3: Go concurrency (goroutines, channels, file watching)

---
‚ö° Implementation Strategy

1. Follow TDD - Write tests first when possible
2. Commit frequently - Following GIT_COMMIT_STYLE_GUIDE.md
3. Build incrementally - Test each component before moving on
4. Document as you go - Add educational comments
5. Use the spec - CODEQUEST_SPEC.md is the source of truth

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.21+** (for building from source)
- **Git** (for commit tracking)
- **Skate** (for data persistence) - Install: `brew install charmbracelet/tap/skate`

**Optional (for AI mentor):**
- **Crush** (OpenRouter): Get API key at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
- **Mods** (local): Install via `brew install charmbracelet/tap/mods`

### Installation

#### Option 1: From Source (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/codequest.git
cd codequest

# Build the binary
make build

# Run CodeQuest
./build/codequest
```

#### Option 2: Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/AutumnsGrove/codequest/cmd/codequest@latest
```

### First Run

**Note:** The application is currently being wired up. The binary builds successfully, but the interactive TUI is not yet launched. See [DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md](DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md) for implementation progress.

When the application is complete, launching CodeQuest will:

1. **Create Your Character** - Choose your name
2. **Accept a Quest** - Browse the Quest Board (press `Q`)
3. **Start Coding** - Make commits in your Git repository
4. **Watch Your Progress** - Earn XP and level up!

```bash
# Planned workflow (not yet functional)
codequest                    # Will launch the game (currently shows placeholder)

# In another terminal, work on your project
cd ~/projects/my-project
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add awesome feature"

# Return to CodeQuest to see your XP and quest progress update!
```

## üìñ Configuration

CodeQuest creates a config file at `~/.config/codequest/config.toml` on first run.

### Basic Configuration

```toml
[character]
name = "YourName"

[game]
difficulty = "normal"  # easy, normal, hard

[git]
auto_detect_repos = true
watch_paths = ["~/projects"]  # Directories to watch for commits

[ai.mentor]
provider = "crush"
model_complex = "openrouter/kimi/k2-0925"
model_simple = "openrouter/deepseek/glm-4.5-air"
temperature = 0.7

[ai.review]
provider = "mods"
model_primary = "qwen3:30b"
auto_review = true
```

### AI Provider Setup

CodeQuest supports three AI providers with automatic fallback: **Crush** (OpenRouter) ‚Üí **Mods** (Local) ‚Üí **Claude** (Anthropic API).

#### Crush (OpenRouter) - Online Models

Crush provides access to various online AI models:

```bash
# Store API key securely in Skate (never in plaintext)
skate set codequest.openrouter_api_key "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Get your key at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)

**Example models in config:**
```toml
[ai.mentor]
provider = "crush"
model_complex = "openrouter/kimi/k2-0925"           # For complex queries
model_simple = "openrouter/deepseek/glm-4.5-air"    # For quick questions
temperature = 0.7

# Other OpenRouter model options:
# - "openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"
# - "openrouter/openai/gpt-4-turbo"
# - "openrouter/google/gemini-pro"
```

#### Mods (Local LLM) - Offline Models

For offline AI assistance with locally-run models:

```bash
# Install Mods
brew install charmbracelet/tap/mods

# Configure your preferred local model
mods --settings
```

**Example models in config:**
```toml
[ai.mentor]
provider = "mods"
model_complex_offline = "qwen3:30b"    # Larger model for deep analysis
model_simple_offline = "qwen3:4b"      # Smaller model for quick help

# Other local model options (if installed via Ollama):
# - "llama3.1:70b"
# - "codellama:34b"
# - "mistral:7b"
# - "deepseek-coder:33b"
```

#### Claude (Anthropic API) - Fallback

For Claude Code integration and complex tasks:

```bash
# Store API key securely in Skate
skate set codequest.anthropic_api_key "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Get your key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

**Example configuration:**
```toml
[ai.mentor]
provider = "claude"
model_complex = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"     # Latest Sonnet 4.5
model_simple = "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"       # Latest Haiku 4.5 (new!)

# Alternative models:
# - "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" (Previous Sonnet 3.5)
# - "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022" (Previous Haiku 3.5)
```

**Note**: API keys are stored in Skate's encrypted storage, never in the config file.

## üéØ How It Works

### XP System

- **Commits**: 10-60 XP (base + lines bonus, capped)
- **Difficulty**: Easy +20%, Normal 1.0x, Hard -20%
- **Wisdom Bonus**: 1% per point above 10
- **Level Progression**: Polynomial curve (L1‚Üí2: 110 XP, L10‚Üí11: 2000 XP)

### Quest Types

- **Commit Quest**: Make N commits
- **Lines Quest**: Add/modify N lines of code
- **More types**: Tests, PR, refactoring (post-MVP)

### Character Stats

- **CodePower**: Increases commit quality bonus
- **Wisdom**: Increases XP gain
- **Agility**: Faster quest completion bonuses

All stats increase by +1 per level-up.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "skate: command not found"

Install Skate for data persistence:
```bash
brew install charmbracelet/tap/skate
```

### "Failed to load configuration"

Create the config directory manually:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/codequest
```

The application will generate a default config on next run.

### "No AI providers available"

Ensure at least one provider is configured:

- **Crush**: Set API key with `skate set codequest.openrouter_api_key "YOUR_KEY"`
- **Mods**: Install with `brew install charmbracelet/tap/mods`

You can also use CodeQuest without AI features - they're optional!

### Git commits not detected

Verify repository path in config:
```toml
[tracking]
repository_paths = ["~/your/project/path"]
```

Ensure you're working in a Git repository:
```bash
cd ~/your/project
git status  # Should show repository info
```

### Session timer not updating

Press **Ctrl+T** to start the timer if it's paused.

### Build fails with "missing go.mod"

Initialize the Go module:
```bash
make init
make deps
```

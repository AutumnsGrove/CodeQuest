# CodeQuest Development Resumption Prompt

I'm continuing development of CodeQuest, a terminal-based gamified developer productivity RPG built with Go. We're implementing the MVP using a focused subagent architecture with 35 sequential tasks.

**Current Progress:** 4 of 35 subagents completed (11%)
- ✅ Subagent 1: Dependencies installed
- ✅ Subagent 2: Configuration system complete
- ✅ Subagent 3: Character model complete
- ✅ Subagent 4: XP engine complete

**Next Step:** Subagent 5 - Write comprehensive tests for Character model and XP engine

**Key Context:**
- All code committed to `main` branch
- Module: `github.com/AutumnsGrove/codequest`
- Complete status: See `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md`
- Full spec: `CODEQUEST_SPEC.md`
- Dev guide: `CLAUDE.md`

**What exists:**
- `internal/config/` - Complete configuration system (84.3% test coverage)
- `internal/game/character.go` - Character model with all 21 fields
- `internal/game/engine.go` - XP calculation engine with balanced progression

**Next subagent task (Subagent 5):**
Create comprehensive test suites:
1. `internal/game/character_test.go` - Test Character model
2. `internal/game/engine_test.go` - Test XP engine

Requirements:
- Test all methods and edge cases
- Table-driven tests preferred
- Target >80% coverage
- Test Character: NewCharacter, AddXP (including multi-level-ups), UpdateStreak, ResetDailyStats, IsToday
- Test Engine: XP curve, commit XP, multipliers (difficulty + wisdom), quest rewards, helper functions

Please start with Subagent 5 and continue the sequential development plan. After completion, proceed to Subagent 6 (Quest model structure).

**That's it! Paste the above when ready to continue.**

# TODO
Current Date: 2025-10-25

## Next Up
- [ ] Add in @BaseProject
- [ ] Clean up directory
- [ ] Update the main execution, it doesn't work. Still shows "Under Construction" message with commit `d0bd00c` tagged.
- [ ] Needs to become a globally callable command from anywhere in the terminal
- [ ] Revert back to Under Construction
 - Less than v1 versioning
 - back to Beta
- [ ] A LOT of these "Development status" and "NExt Steps" plans are either outdated or versioning poorly. The "consistent file updates" update needs to happen. Better guidance with Claude.md?
